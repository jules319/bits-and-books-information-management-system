## SQL Database
The SQL database and related files can be found in the `sql-database` folder. This folder contains:
- `data-loader-utils/`: A folder containing the data files to be loaded into the database.
- `sql_create.sql`: A text file containing all of the scripts needed to create the database schema on an empty database, including indexes and views.
- `example-sql/`: A folder containing example queries, indexes, insert/delete statements, transactions and views

To recreate the database from scratch, follow the instructions in the `data_files/README.txt` file.
